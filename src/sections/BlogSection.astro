          <div class="text-body-light space-y-3">
            <p>Winter can be harsh on your plumbing system. When temperatures drop, water inside your pipes can freeze, expand, and cause pipes to burst—leading to costly water damage. To prevent this, insulate exposed pipes in unheated areas like basements, attics, and garages. Pipe insulation is affordable and easy to install.</p>
            <p>Let faucets drip slightly during extreme cold to keep water moving and reduce the risk of freezing. Seal any cracks or openings in walls near pipes to keep cold air out. If you plan to be away, keep your home heated to at least 55°F (13°C) and ask a neighbor to check on your property.</p>
            <p>If a pipe does freeze, turn off the main water supply and call a professional plumber immediately. Taking these precautions can save you from major headaches and expensive repairs.</p>

          <div class="text-body-light space-y-3">
            <p>Modern plumbing isn’t just about convenience—it’s also about sustainability. Eco-friendly plumbing solutions can help you save water, lower utility bills, and reduce your environmental impact. Consider installing low-flow toilets, faucets, and showerheads to significantly cut water usage without sacrificing performance.</p>
            <p>Tankless water heaters are another great option, providing hot water on demand and using less energy than traditional tanks. Fixing leaks promptly and upgrading to energy-efficient appliances can further boost your home’s eco-credentials.</p>
            <p>Ask your plumber about greywater systems and rainwater harvesting for irrigation. These solutions not only conserve water but also promote a greener, more sustainable lifestyle for your family or business.</p>

          <div class="text-body-light space-y-3">
            <p>Some plumbing issues can be handled with a DIY approach, but others require the expertise of a professional. Persistent low water pressure, recurring clogs, or slow drains often indicate deeper problems in your plumbing system.</p>
            <p>Unusual noises like banging or gurgling pipes, water stains on walls or ceilings, and unexplained increases in your water bill are all red flags. If you notice foul odors coming from your drains or see visible signs of mold, it’s time to call a licensed plumber.</p>
            <p>Addressing these issues early can prevent costly damage and ensure your plumbing system remains safe and efficient. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help when in doubt!</p>
